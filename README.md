- 👋 Hi, I’m Nerd1029
- 👀 I’m interested in Python development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python game development
- 📝 I'm currently working on a project called CodeBox. (See its GitHub page here: https://github.com/Nerd1029/CodeBox) 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I find C#, C++, C, Java, and Javascript revolting and I would not dare to touch them with a 20ft metal rod
